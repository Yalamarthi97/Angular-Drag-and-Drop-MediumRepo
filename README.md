## Dragula
I have become a huge fan of Dragula just because of its simplicity in adding the drag and drop feature in Angular

## Implementing Drag and Drop in Angular
After installing Dragula in Angular, All which has to be done is make 2 or more divs/containers use the same dragula value and 
Lo! Behold .. Dragging elements between them is easy as 1 2 3!

# Future Works
1. Planning to extend Dragula Drag and Drop feature into some Tabular Sheet where we can drag elements into the cells of the sheet
2. Get the data of dropped images/details and stuff into the tabular sheet into a Json or someother format to get from it ( Similar to drop and rearrange and then get the image/element position based on cells)
3. Try my had at CSS to auto resize and stuff for a whole webpage where everything can be rearranged.
